    <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple">Stewardship</h3>
<p>
    This core value applies not only to Centric’s resources, but to our client’s resources as well. It is important to look out for our clients and act in their best interest. Perhaps a simpler solution could provide them similar results to a larger, more complex solution. It’s not about billable hours, it’s about doing the right thing. In the long run, our clients will see and appreciate that we value their assets as much as our own.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple">Culture</h3>
<p>
    We set out to build the best culture in the consulting industry — one that cares about the work we do and the people we work with. A culture that celebrates individuals and creates lifelong friendships.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple">Delivery Excellence</h3>
<p>
    Some consultants find it easy to deflect the failure of a project onto the client or the environment. Maybe the original scope was not realistic. Or maybe the client did not provide the level of support to a project they initially promised. But it’s always important to reflect on one’s own involvement in the project to deliver excellent results. Instead of pointing the finger at problems, we – at Centric – ask ourselves what can we do to deliver excellence. There are often many ways you can change approach to improve delivery and results.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple">Innovation</h3>
<p>
    Our role as consultants is to find solutions in places where it seems like there aren’t any. Our clients look to us not just to execute to a project plan, but to provide creative solutions to complex problems. When delivery gets difficult, taking a step back and finding ways to innovate can lead to breakthroughs. We pride ourselves in constantly looking for new, breakthrough solutions to solve problems for our clients.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple">Greater Good</h3>
<p>
    Our core value of “ignite passion for the greater good” is one we love to carry out on both the national and local level. Nationally, we choose a cause to support with donations at our annual meetings. In recent years, we have provided support for the Flint, Michigan water crisis, packed meals to send to developed nations, and collected school supplies for students in underserved schools. Our individual teams are also highly committed to several local charitable causes and host team volunteer activities several times a year to serve food, build and repair houses, clean up neighborhoods, and work directly with others in need of support.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple">Integrity and Openness</h3>
<p>
    One of the most important ways to build a long-term relationship with a client is to first build trust. The best way to build trust with clients is to embrace integrity and openness in all communications, even when the news is bad. Truth in reporting the progress and status of a project, no matter how intimidating it may seem, is the best way to prevent small problems from becoming large ones. Delaying bad news in the hopes that things might “get better” can be a slippery slope to losing trust with the client. Once a client starts questioning the integrity of your reporting, trust has been lost. Once trust is lost, losing clients is often close behind.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple">Balanced Life</h3>
<p>
    Living a balanced life provides perhaps the most important element to managing client interactions: perspective. When the going gets tough, we make it a point to remember that our clients, just like ourselves, are coming to work every day to try and do a good job, go home and take care of their families. Our focus is not on winning a disagreement. Our focus is on maintaining a balanced perspective. Trying to see things from our client’s point of view is a powerful way to diffuse heated situations. It is important to remember that our clients do not hire consultants to solve easy problems. But, in the face of difficult client interactions and situations, our core values at Centric provide us with perspective. These values, when put into action, serve as a reliable foundation.
